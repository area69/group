            <h2>Personality</h2>
            <p>I am someone with a laid-back personality, as they say. I like doing things at my own pace. I also like exploring new things, always curious about what the world has to offer.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="section alt">
            <h2>Experience</h2>
            <p>I graduated last year and I currently have no working experience yet. I've only attended some trainings to expand my knowledge about the IT industry that I will soon use once I land my first job.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>Interests</h2>
            <p>I usually play video games as my hobby. I also enjoy building LEGOs. Once I have the time and the money to buy them, I will be a LEGO collector.</p>

            <h2>Challenges</h2>
            <p>I find it difficult to focus on something. I either hyperfocus and ignore everything or I don't pay attention at all. I also find it difficult to get over my self-doubt, especially when I'm trying anything new. But every obstacle is a chance for me to improve. Stepping out of the comfort zone is one way to grow.</p>
